# Finalquiz
This project is about myself and how well someone would know me based on questions given to them.
 ### Process & Documentation
For this quiz I used a pixel cloud background to set the mood and keep it fun. I then added each image to the pages. This quiz is comprised of 10 questions. I created and index.html page with all of my quetion sin cluding the previous and next buttons. I then created two seperate js files. One file was for fucntions the next and previous buttons as well as dtermining certain values for the local storage. The other js file I had to seperate so I could dispplay the outcome once the quiz was done. Based on the user input, if the person scored over 70% the final screen would be green and if it was under 70% it would be red.
### Challenges & Struggles
The hardest part of this assignment was getting the proper percentage to show once I clicked view reults. Another thing that was difficult was getting the local storage setup. Once I worked that out though everything was pretty simple.
